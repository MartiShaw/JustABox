<p>Pollution. It is a big deal in the world. Too many people are not recycling, and throwing away trash that can be as easily recycled.
    According to www.dosomething.org, we throw away over 75% of recyclables, but only 30% makes it to a recycling plant, where it is recycled. That means over 3/4 of the world's recyclables are thrown away, but 3/10 of it becomes recycled.
